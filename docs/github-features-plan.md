# GitHub Features Plan (PRD-ish)

Goal: implement GitHub-powered workflows (PR panel + start sessions from Issue/PR) on top of the existing GitHub auth foundation.

Non-goals (for this phase)
- Rebuild auth/token storage (already implemented)
- Rebuild worktree lifecycle/cleanup (already implemented)
- Add hard context size caps/fallback logic (explicitly out of scope)

## Existing Primitives (MUST reuse)

These already exist; do not reinvent.

GitHub auth + connected user
- UI: `packages/ui/src/components/sections/openchamber/GitHubSettings.tsx`
- Runtime API: `GitHubAPI` in `packages/ui/src/lib/api/types.ts`
- Web endpoints: `packages/web/server/index.js` (`/api/github/*`)
- Desktop Tauri commands: `packages/desktop/src-tauri/src/commands/github.rs`
- VS Code bridge + storage: `packages/vscode/src/bridge.ts`, `packages/vscode/src/githubAuth.ts`

Projects and directories
- Projects store (one project == one repo path): `packages/ui/src/stores/useProjectsStore.ts`
- Active project selection is already used across the app; use it to scope all GitHub operations.

Worktree sessions
- Worktree creation and session wiring:
  - `packages/ui/src/lib/worktreeSessionCreator.ts`
  - Reuse `createWorktreeSession()` and `createWorktreeSessionForBranch(projectDirectory, branchName)`.
- Worktree cleanup/delete behavior is already present in session deletion flow:
  - `packages/ui/src/components/session/SessionDialogs.tsx`

“Synthetic parts” / hidden context in chat
- SDK supports `TextPartInput.synthetic?: boolean`:
  - `node_modules/@opencode-ai/sdk/dist/v2/gen/types.gen.d.ts`
- UI filters synthetic parts out of rendering:
  - `packages/ui/src/lib/messages/synthetic.ts`
- Existing “seed new session from assistant answer” uses a hidden preface part:
  - `packages/ui/src/stores/useSessionStore.ts` (`createSessionFromAssistantMessage`)
  - `packages/ui/src/lib/opencode/client.ts` (`sendMessage({ prefaceText })`)

Git tab layout
- Git view where PR panel will be inserted:
  - `packages/ui/src/components/views/GitView.tsx`
- Changes + Commit already exist; History is below.

## Guiding Principles

- One directory/project == one git repo. All GitHub actions are scoped to the active project.
- Do not show synthetic context to the user; only show the human prompt.
- If the user lacks permission for an operation (merge, create branch, etc), degrade to “Open in GitHub”.
- Prefer server-side Octokit for web runtime; for desktop/vscode, implement equivalent runtime commands/bridge handlers.
- Keep UI consistent with existing patterns (provider OAuth, worktree sessions, commit message generation).

## Feature A: Git Tab PR Panel (Create / Status / Merge)

Status: implemented.

### Intent
While working on a feature branch, show PR status and actions inside the Git tab, without leaving the app.

### Placement
Implemented between Commit and History in `packages/ui/src/components/views/GitView.tsx`.

### Visibility Rules
- Show only if:
  - repo is detected (`isGitRepo === true`)
  - branch is not the “base branch”

Base branch source (reuse existing config):
- `activeProject.worktreeDefaults.baseBranch` from `packages/ui/src/stores/useProjectsStore.ts`
- fallback default: `main`

### UI States
1) GitHub not connected
- Show CTA: “Connect GitHub” (link to Settings -> OpenChamber -> GitHub).

2) Connected but repo not resolvable to GitHub
- Show “Open remote in browser” if remote URL exists.
- Show error text explaining remote must be GitHub.

3) PR does not exist for current branch
- Show create form:
  - base branch (default: baseBranch)
  - title (default from branch name)
  - draft toggle
  - description textarea
  - “Generate description” button (AI)
  - “Create PR” button

4) PR exists
- Show summary:
  - state (draft/open/merged)
  - PR number + title
  - checks summary
  - mergeability (if available)
  - “Open in GitHub”
- If user has merge permission and PR is mergeable:
  - merge method dropdown (merge/squash/rebase)
  - “Merge” button
- If PR is draft:
  - “Ready” button (mark ready for review)
  - Merge disabled until ready
- If cannot merge:
  - disable merge button + show “Open in GitHub”

### AI “Generate description”
Implemented as a PR-specific generator (separate prompt/endpoint/command).

Inputs:
- base branch ref (prefers `origin/<base>` when available)
- head branch ref
- committed range diff: `git diff <base>...<head>` (file list from `git diff --name-only <base>...<head>`)

Output:
- `title` (<= 80 chars, no commit-style prefixes)
- `body` (GFM markdown sections: Summary/Testing/Notes)

### Required GitHub API Calls
- Resolve repo from git remote URL (origin)
- Find PR by head branch
- Create PR
- Get PR details + checks
- Merge PR
- Mark PR ready for review (GraphQL)

Checks logic (implemented):
- prefer GitHub Actions check-runs (`/commits/{sha}/check-runs`)
- fallback to classic commit statuses (`/commits/{sha}/status`)

### Implementation Notes
- Web runtime should use server endpoints + Octokit (token stays server-side).
- Desktop/vscode should use their runtime handlers (similar to GitHub auth) to avoid exposing token.

Implemented code pointers
- UI section: `packages/ui/src/components/views/git/PullRequestSection.tsx`
- Web server endpoints:
  - `GET /api/github/pr/status`
  - `POST /api/github/pr/create`
  - `POST /api/github/pr/merge`
  - `POST /api/github/pr/ready`
- PR description generator:
  - `POST /api/git/pr-description`
  - Desktop: `generate_pr_description`
  - VS Code: `api:git/pr-description`

## Feature B: Start Session From GitHub Issue

Status: implemented.

### Intent
Create a new session seeded with issue context, without polluting chat with large issue bodies/comments.

### Entry Point
Project header menu in `packages/ui/src/components/session/SessionSidebar.tsx`.

Add new item:
- “New session from GitHub issue”

### Modal UI
Issue picker modal:
- list issues for current repo (open by default)
- search by title/number
- direct input:
  - full URL
  - `#123` or `123`
- checkbox: “Create in worktree”

Implementation notes:
- modal layout matches Timeline dialog styling/patterns
- “Open Repo” + per-issue “Open in GitHub” use `<a href=... target="_blank">` (desktop webview safe)

### Worktree option
If enabled:
- create a worktree session (reuse `createWorktreeSessionForBranch`)
- branch naming convention:
  - `issue-<number>-<slug>` (slug derived from title)
- base branch:
  - `activeProject.worktreeDefaults.baseBranch`

If disabled:
- create normal session in project root directory.

### Session Bootstrap (message)
Send a single user message with:
1) Visible text part: concise prompt, e.g.
   - “Review the issue; summarize requirements + unknowns; ask clarifying questions; gather needed code context; propose plan + next actions; do not implement until user confirms.”
2) Hidden synthetic parts: issue payload
   - issue title/body
   - labels, assignees, author
   - comments (ordered)
   - metadata (repo, number, url)

This must use SDK-supported `TextPartInput.synthetic = true` so it is not rendered.
Do not invent a new hidden-context mechanism.

### Required GitHub API Calls
- List issues
- Get issue by number
- List issue comments

Implemented code pointers
- UI modal: `packages/ui/src/components/session/GitHubIssuePickerDialog.tsx`
- Shared sendMessage synthetic parts: `packages/ui/src/lib/opencode/client.ts`
- Web server endpoints:
  - `GET /api/github/issues/list`
  - `GET /api/github/issues/get`
  - `GET /api/github/issues/comments`
- Desktop Tauri commands:
  - `github_issues_list`
  - `github_issue_get`
  - `github_issue_comments`
- VS Code bridge handlers:
  - `api:github/issues:list`
  - `api:github/issues:get`
  - `api:github/issues:comments`

## Feature C: Start Session From GitHub PR (with worktree checkout)

Status: implemented.

### Intent
Create a session seeded with PR context, with optional worktree checkout of PR branch (including forks).

### Entry Point
Project header menu in `packages/ui/src/components/session/SessionSidebar.tsx`.

Add new item:
- “New session from GitHub PR”

### Modal UI
PR picker modal:
- list open PRs
- search by title/number
- direct input:
  - full URL
  - `#123` or `123`
- checkbox: “Create session in PR worktree”

Implementation notes:
- modal layout matches Timeline dialog styling/patterns
- list pagination: “Load more” (page-based, `per_page=50`)
- optional toggle: include full diff in hidden context

### Worktree behavior
If enabled:
- if PR is from same repo:
  - fetch PR head into `FETCH_HEAD`
  - create worktree using the PR branch name, starting at `FETCH_HEAD` (does not change main worktree)
- if PR is from fork:
  - fetch PR head from fork clone URL into `FETCH_HEAD`
  - create worktree using the PR branch name, starting at `FETCH_HEAD`

Fallbacks:
- if fetch/remote fails or permission denied:
  - still create a normal session with PR context
  - show toast with error; user can open PR in GitHub

### Session Bootstrap (message)
Same synthetic-parts approach as Issues.

Hidden parts should include:
- PR title/body
- PR comments + review comments
- changed files list
- optionally full diff (explicitly no caps)
- checks/status summary

Visible prompt text should instruct:
- review PR intent; call out intent/implementation mismatch
- identify risks + missing pieces
- gather needed repo context; no speculation; ask for missing info
- propose a plan + next actions; do not implement until user confirms

Implemented code pointers
- UI modal: `packages/ui/src/components/session/GitHubPullRequestPickerDialog.tsx`
- Web server endpoints:
  - `GET /api/github/pulls/list`
  - `GET /api/github/pulls/context`
- Desktop Tauri commands:
  - `github_prs_list`
  - `github_pr_context`
- VS Code bridge handlers:
  - `api:github/pulls:list`
  - `api:github/pulls:context`

## Feature E: PR Context Helpers (Checks/Comments -> Chat)

Intent
Reduce PR iteration loop time by letting the user add targeted PR signal (failed checks, review feedback) into the next chat message without polluting visible chat.

Placement
Inside the existing Git tab PR panel (`packages/ui/src/components/views/git/PullRequestSection.tsx`).

UI
- “Add failed checks to context” (only if failures exist)
- “Add PR comments to context” (issue comments + review comments)
- “Refresh checks” affordance

Behavior
- All added context is sent as synthetic parts (never shown in chat rendering).
- Failed checks payload should include: check name, status/conclusion, details URL, and any available summary/text.
- Comments payload should include: author, body, file/path + line when available, and comment URL.
- Keep visible user prompt short; include only human intent.

Implementation notes
- Reuse Feature C PR context endpoint (`/api/github/pulls/context`) as the single source for comments/files/checks/diff.
- Prefer a compact checks rollup (passed/total) with optional expand into failing checks.

### Required GitHub API Calls
- List PRs
- Get PR
- List issue comments for PR
- List review comments
- List files
- Get checks/status

## Cross-cutting: “Synthetic Parts” Sending API

Current behavior:
- `opencodeClient.sendMessage()` supports `prefaceText` which becomes a separate `TextPartInput`.
- There is no first-class way (yet) to mark arbitrary parts as `synthetic: true` from callsites.

Required change (shared for Features B/C):
- Extend `opencodeClient.sendMessage()` (in `packages/ui/src/lib/opencode/client.ts`) to support synthetic parts.

Recommended minimal API change:
- allow `prefaceTextSynthetic?: boolean` (default true when used for hidden context)
- allow `additionalParts?: Array<{ text: string; synthetic?: boolean; files?: ... }>`
- ensure generated `TextPartInput` includes `synthetic` when requested

This should reuse the existing filtering/rendering logic (no new UI hacks).

## Cross-cutting: Repo Resolution

Need a single helper to map current project repo -> GitHub owner/repo.

Inputs:
- project directory root
- git remote URL (origin)

Behavior:
- support common GitHub URL formats:
  - `git@github.com:OWNER/REPO.git`
  - `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO.git`
  - `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO`

Output:
- `{ owner, repo }` or null

Use this for all GitHub feature endpoints.

## Cross-cutting: Permission / Fallback Rules

- Merge button enabled only if merge endpoint succeeds or mergeability indicates allowed.
- If not allowed:
  - show “Open in GitHub” as primary action
- For PR worktrees from forks:
  - if remote add/fetch fails => create normal session + “Open in GitHub”

## Work Breakdown (Suggested Order)

Phase 1: Shared plumbing
1) Repo resolution helper (remote URL -> owner/repo)
2) New message sending helper supporting `synthetic: true` parts
3) GitHub endpoints/commands for issue + PR fetch (read-only)

Phase 2: Session bootstrap flows
4) Issue picker modal + session bootstrap
5) PR picker modal + session bootstrap
6) PR worktree checkout (fork support)

Phase 3: Git tab PR panel
7) PR detect/status in Git tab
8) Create PR from branch
9) AI generate PR description
10) Merge (with fallback)

## Open Questions (for later)

- PR description generator prompt format: do we want the exact same “highlights” UI as commit gen, or a single-shot body generation?
- Worktree naming collision strategy for PR-based worktrees (owner/ref collisions) beyond current `sanitizeWorktreeSlug`.
